# MultipleLinearRegressionProject
In this project, I build a Multiple Linear Regression model to study the linear relationship between 'Chance of getting graduate admit' wrt to different factors like GRE score, TOEFL Score, SOP etc. I have used two performance metrics RMSE (Root Mean Square Value) and R2 Score value to compute our model performance.
